Legend of Adventures is a data driven roguelike game.
It is made so that a designer with minimal coding
experience would be able to make their own levels
populated by custom monsters, items, and tile types.
By editing specific XML files, as well as adding their
own XML level files and sprite sheets, designers can
create and test their own games without having to write
or compile any game code. Movement and line of sight are
done on a hex grid, and players attack by trying to enter
into enemies' spaces. Players can use specific items to
enhance stats such as speed, power, defense, sight range,
and luck. Legend of Adventures was written in C++ and XML
and was completed over a 2.5 month period.
